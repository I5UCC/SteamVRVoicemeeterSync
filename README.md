# SteamVRVoicemeeterVolumeSync
An autohotkey script, which syncs Windows Sound with Voicemeeter Potato. Great for changing volume in SteamVR

Register the app.vrmanifest file manually by running it with SteamVR(vrmonitor.exe)

This Script will load the XML-File ***vr.xml*** on SteamVR startup and when SteamVR Closes will load in ***default.xml***.
